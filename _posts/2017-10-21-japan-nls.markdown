This year, the National Leadership Seminar (NLS) is going international. The Western Region doesn’t just serve Arrowmen in 16 different states across the US, including Hawaii and Alaska but also Scouts and Scouters across the world in Japan, Australia, and many other countries as well. Just like any Arrowmen from around the Region, <!--More-->those who live in Japan and other foreign countries deserve to be taught how to be effective leaders and experience an Order of the Arrow staple.

<!--more-->

November 10-12, 2017 the Region’s best trainers will head across the Pacific to the Tama Hills Recreation area in Tokyo, Japan to deliver the state-of-the-art leadership course. This tried and true program provides opportunities for both youth Arrowmen and adults. If you’re an adult leader in any scouting level and you have Arrowmen in your unit, you won’t want to miss out on an opportunity to send youth and adults to an NLS. Participants don’t just learn how to be better and more effective leaders in the OA and Scouting, but in life.

To commemorate this special event and help put it on a one of a kind patch set has been made. All the proceeds from sales will go directly towards putting on the NLS. Take a look <a href="https://tradingpost.oa-bsa.org/SearchResults.asp?Cat=58">here</a> and help the Region bring the seminar to the Arrowmen of Japan.

If you live in Japan or are just in the neighborhood you don’t want to miss out on this awesome opportunity.  There are still spots available, just go <a href="http://western.oa-bsa.org/program/training/nls/">here</a> to sign up.
