Don’t miss out on this opportunity to take a little bit of
jamboree home with you. One of the jamboree’s four shows was focused around
fellowship and service, highlighting the Order of the Arrow. To celebrate all
the Order of the Arrow has to offer and what it does for scouting a special
commemorative patch was made for the occasion. Only a limited amount of patches
were made and supply is running out fast.

The patch was designed with the show in mind. From the giant
globes to the excited crowd, you’ll want to take home this one of a kind
snapshot. To get your “Fellowship and Service” patch just go to the <a href="https://tradingpost.oa-bsa.org/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=2017-023">Order of
