Starting around 5:00pm on Friday, September 15, 530 Arrowmen from all around Area 4 gathered at the Irvine Outdoor Education Center in Irvine, California for a weekend filled with fun and fellowship. Starting back in 2016, Section W-4N and W-4S began brainstorming a potential Area Conclave - the first one in nearly 27 years. The two Section Chiefs, Matthias L. and Javier V., eventually agreed and began meeting to construct a solid base for the Area Conclave.

This following year, in 2017, joint Area Council of Chiefs Meetings, or COCs, began being held. Jorge Salazar and Matthew McMahan, the new leadership, headed the COCs in the year leading up to the Area Conclave, which was eventually dubbed the ‘Areaclave’. At Areaclave, trainings, patch trading, auctions, sports, museums, shows, and lodge fairs were amongst the many activities offered to the Arrowmen in attendance. On Friday, the evening started off with some fun as lodge chiefs from the nine lodges in Area 4 were called up to have a dance off before cracker barrel. The festivities began early the next morning starting with Meet the Man, where National Vice Chief Talon Parker and Western Region Chief Manué Lopez fielded questions from their W4 brothers. Later in the morning, training sessions were held by several special guests from in and out of the Area. Just before lunch, the traditional Lodge Fair took place alongside the Camp Promotions competition. Amongst the lodge’s booths were large Jenga, finger football, branding, and even an official Skippy approval booth (he’s wicked important).

After lunch, lodges met to set a plan for Flight of the RamBird, a relay-style race where lodges competed head-to-head in a series of mini-competitions to achieve dominance and bragging rights over the other eight lodges. Flight of the RamBird, however, was only the beginning for sports - the classic Lodge Ball competition was brought back with a new tournament format to bring the best lodges from each Section to play against each other to crown an Area 4 Lodge Ball champion. Malibu maintained its typical dominance in Section W-4N and advanced to the final match versus W-4S Puvunga before pulling off the win for Section W-4N. Everyone is looking forward to see if it is possible to dethrone an Area champion going into 2018. That afternoon, silent auctions were held during the Lodge Ball competitions for adults and those youth not as interested in sports. The Outdoor Education Center’s facilities were used to full extent as the pool, zipline, and ranges were opened for all Arrowmen to use. Later in the afternoon, Section elections took place where Tuku’ut, Jorge Salazar, was elected Section Chief, Malibu’s, Tyler Grey, was elected Section Vice Chief, and Spe-Le-Yai, Gavin Cho, was elected Section Secretary. After the elections that evening, Polynesian dancers were brought in to perform. During the show, new section leadership and lodge chiefs were called to the stage to learn some basic Polynesian dance moves. After showing off their skills in front of the massive Areaclave, the show ended as everyone was treated to a ‘lit’ finale with a fire dancer showcasing his best moves. The evening raged on with a successful live auction (which raised over $5,000) and a pow wow where guests were brought to Areaclave to perform their traditional Native American songs as dance competitors and new Ordeal members alike danced and shared in the Order of the Arrow’s Native American roots. Finally, as Saturday began to conclude, Tuku’ut Lodge’s famous carne asada was served for Area 4 to enjoy.

The weekend ended with a respectful Interfaith Worship Service on the Outdoor Stage. The final event was the Closing Show and Awards Ceremony. Here, lodges supported one another as Section Chiefs Jorge Salazar of W-4N and Matthew McMahan of W-4S presented awards and thanks to that year’s Council of Chiefs members. The show ended as Manué Lopez inducted the Section leadership into their new offices. The weekend was one for the ages, as lifelong memories and friendships were created and remembered.
